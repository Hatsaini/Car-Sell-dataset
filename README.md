# Car Sales Analysis Project ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling on a car sales dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. It highlights skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, and regression modeling.

## Notebooks Summary

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Tasks Performed:**
  - Data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
  - Calculated descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
  - Visualized trends and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Detected and removed outliers to improve data quality.

### 2. **Regression Modeling**
- **Tasks Performed:**
  - Split the data into training and testing datasets for two cases:
    - Case 1: Training data is 10% of the entire dataset.
    - Case 2: Training data is 90% of the entire dataset.
  - Trained four linear regression models under these conditions:
    - **Model-a:** Case 1 with two most correlated input features.
    - **Model-b:** Case 1 with two least correlated input features.
    - **Model-c:** Case 2 with two most correlated input features.
    - **Model-d:** Case 2 with two least correlated input features.
  - Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
  - Visualized the results and provided insights with carefully adjusted scales for better clarity.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Project Highlights
- Showcased proficiency in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.
- Demonstrated the ability to train, evaluate, and compare machine learning models using regression techniques.
- Provided insightful analysis through well-crafted visualizations.
