# Car Sales Analysis Project ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a car sales dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to uncover key insights, clean and preprocess data, and visualize trends to better understand the dataset.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values and ensured data consistency.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Visualization:** Created plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore trends and relationships.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and removed outliers to improve data quality.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Highlights
- Improved dataset quality by handling missing data and outliers.
- Gained insights through statistical analysis and effective visualizations.
- Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
